# sorter

A modified version of a sorter, available to use at:

https://duncanlang.github.io/sorter/

## Change

The original version of the sorter has you manually edit the javascript to create your list, this version instead allows you to create your list on the page itself.

## Credits

The original is made by [biasorter](https://biasorter.tumblr.com/), apparently.
